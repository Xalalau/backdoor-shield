**!!WARNING!!**

>This is a very complicated world and using this addon can have consequences! If you go on, don't try to whitelist an addon with a DRM!!! There has already been a case of loss of license and I do not take any responsibility for that! Use at your own risk!! And don't expect support about fancy security things.
>
>Another thing to consider is that it just gives you an extra layer of security. You'll be able to scan your files with the bs_scan command and also avoid a series of unwanted executions with a basic real-time protection, but don't think that this addon will get you out of trouble! It's easy to detect and circumvent it.

>Anyway, I learned a lot by writing this code for a few days and I hope it'll be useful for someone - so enjoy!
