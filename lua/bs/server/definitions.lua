   Attention!! Low-risk locations will cause detouring of protected functions to be

   and most problably call us back because we keep the original addresses locked down.

-- BLACK AND SUSPECT LISTS
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--[[
  In the real-time protection scenario, blacklists cause warnings and interruptions in
  execution, while suspect lists add details to the logs and, consequently, help us
  to better identify threats.

  When used by the file scanner, both lists generate complete reports. In this case,
  we use the high, medium and low divisions to assign a weight to each detection and
  calculate a risk. For example. many low-risk detections can be listed as medium-risk,
  while some medium plus low-risk detections can be heavy enough to be listed as high-
  risk. This system helps to make detected backdoors more visible by showing them above
  irrelevant results - and, in fact, they end up concentraded on high-risk with some
  in the medium. I've never seen a detection in the low-risk section.

  Finally, if someone makes the foolish decision to add a common pattern to one of these
  lists, the addon will return many false positives, probably turning the console into
  a giant log hell.

  Be wise, be safe. And thanks for being here.
