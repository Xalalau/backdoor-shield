Convar to disable the real time protection (disable detouring)

Light scan

Complete scan

show progress every 500 files / Utils_GetTotalFilesAndFolders

Block this
    RunString(RunStringFakedName() OtherProtectedFuncRenamed())

    Ex:
        local LocalFakeNameRunStr = _G.RunString
        self.__G.FakeNameRunStr = self.__G["RunString"]
        LocalFakeNameRunStr([[FakeNameRunStr("print('Fail')")]])

Other addons detection:

    We can automatically be detected by other addons with
        debug.getlocal
        debug.getupvalue
        jit.util.funck
        error (trace)
        ...
        Who knows

    Also, they can see us by reading the folders or checking for our console commands

Print a warning if someone try to table.Copy _G

It might be a good idea to validate http.Post response

It would be nice if I detected associations like
    local somevar = globalGvar

Print a warning if util.AddNetworkString is created after the addons finished loading

It seems that it's possible to delete server's Lua files. If so, how to protect them?
